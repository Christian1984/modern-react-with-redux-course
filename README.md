# JSX Basics

- babel is used to "translate" JSX so it can be interpreted by basically any web browser. babel provides a nice tool to check on the fly how a given JSX is translated at https://babeljs.io/repl
- quotes vs double-quotes: in JSX-components double quotes should always be used to indicate a string, but for non-JSX-components, single quotes are used (by community convention). but from a technical point of view, it does not matter. i'll use double quotes.
- `class` vs `className`: an html `class` property should be converted to `className` when converted to JSX. this is simply to avoid collisions between the JavaScript `class` keyword and the property inside JSX.
- `for` vs `htmlFor`: for the same reason, the `for` attribute (of labels) is replaced with `htmlFor` to prevent collisions
- js variables or methods can be reference from JSX with curly braces, e.g. `<button>{getMyVar()}</button>` would show a button with the text returned by `getMyVar()`.
